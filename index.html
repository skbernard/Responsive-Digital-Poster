            <box-element boxTitle="ABSTRACT" ><a name="abstract"></a>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> To gain insight into the overall impact, acceptance, and utilization of
                    interactive digital poster presentations in medical/scientific congresses and to educate ISMPP
                    members on perceived advantages and disadvantages of this form of data communication.</p>
                <p><b>Research design and methods:</b> A 10-question survey questionnaire was designed,
                    circulated via e-mail to ISMPP members, and responses invited between December 20, 2011 and January 9, 2012.</p>
                <p><b>Results:</b> Of 111 respondents who completed the survey (48.6% pharmaceutical company, 40.5% medical
                    communications company, 3.6% publisher, and 7.2% other), 28.8% work with interactive posters,
                    50% utilize QR codes, and 43.2% have viewed interactive posters in a congress setting.
                    Responses suggest the greatest potential advantages of interactive posters include increased
                    audience engagement (56.9%), wider data dissemination (47.1%), enhanced poster metric tracking (49%),
                    and increased capacity for audio/visual presentation (67.6%). An increased need for overall
                    technology management resource was cited as the greatest disadvantage (80%). Other obstacles
                    included cost (33.6%) and current congress regulations (27.1%). The majority of respondents
                    agree/strongly agree that this format allows for better communication of data versus traditional
                    printed posters and that congresses will slowly adopt this technology (56.9% and 63.9%, respectively).</p>
                <p><b>Conclusion:</b> The majority of respondents believe interactive digital posters enhance
                    communication and dissemination of data and offer a dynamic forum for presenters to increase
                    audience engagement. As congresses adopt these technologies, it will be important to monitor
                    whether differences among guidelines emerge, as well as any potential compliance issues.</p>

            <box-element boxTitle="BACKGROUND" ><a name="background"></a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presentation of data as a traditional printed poster at medical/scientific
                        congresses has remained an essentially unchanged format for decades.
                        Although they are the accepted medium for dissemination of medical/scientific
                        information in a congress setting, printed poster presentations are viewed by
                        some as inadequate by failing to engage the audience and promote effective
                        discussion of the content<sup>1,2</sup></li>
                    <li>As technology grows and evolves in other disciplines, it is intuitive to expect an
                        evolution of technology in the dissemination of medical/scientific information in
                        a congress setting</li>
                    <li>Evolving technology has already supported the integration of 2-dimensional
                        quick response (QR) codes that may be utilized to share a pdf of the poster
                        electronically. Furthermore, “going green” by utilizing QR codes prevents the
                        need for printing large numbers of poster handouts on paper</li>
                    <li>Exploring the current and future utilization of advances in technology including
                        digital interactive posters presentations may provide critical insight into the
                        potential opportunities to improve dissemination of scientific information</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive poster technology is gaining a foothold in the dissemination of peer-reviewed
                        scientific data from pharmaceutical industry-sponsored studies: many congresses have begun to
                        utilize this technology; nearly one third of all ISMPP member respondents already work with
                        digital interactive posters, while half are currently using QR code technology</li>
                    <li>The majority of respondents believe interactive digital posters enhance communication and
                        dissemination of data and offer a dynamic forum for presenters to increase audience engagement</li>
                    <li>The majority of respondents believe that congresses will slowly integrate digital interactive
                        poster technology in the future</li>
                    <li>As congresses adopt these technologies, it will be important to monitor whether differences
                        among guidelines emerge, as well as any potential compliance issues</li>
